### Hi 👋, I'm Stephen

👋I am currently in my second year pursuing a degree in Business Technology Management with a minor of Computer Science; Database systems at Toronto Metropolitan University. 

📒 I'm passionate about learning Data Analysis and Cyber Security!

💬 Aside from the technical aspect of my self, I love to work out 🏋️‍♂️, bike around lakeshore 🚲 , and explore the beautiful sights of nature 🌱!

💪 Outside of my studies, my primary hobby lies in the gym, where my journey into Data Analysis began. Through meticulous tracking and analysis of my fitness progress on 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐥, I navigate through raw data to assess the effectiveness of various exercises and such. This not only unveils insights into what works and what doesn't but also propels me to implement strategic changes, aiming to enhance both performance and results. This initial experience marks my enthralling introduction to the captivating world of Data Analysis.
